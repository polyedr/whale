cats and dogs example:
test, train, validation

test
    cats
    dogs

train
    cats
    dogs

validation
    cats
    dogs

First in use were train_dir and validation_dir only.
Maybe test_dir is the directory where are stored images.
But for cats and dogs dataset the initial train folder was splitted to train, test and validation, even that test folder was existed initially.

Loop over all the files in directory
Create list with all the filenames
Copy first half filenames to the train folder
Copy second half filenames to the train folder
